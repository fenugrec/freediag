This summarizes the changes between freediag releases. Each release package
contains a more detailed changelog.

Since ~ 2009, I (fenugrec) have maintained the freediag project on sourceforge.
I took the liberty of modifying the version number format to MAJOR.MINOR, the MINOR number
written with 2 digits ( %02d if you will). Some early versions had a suffixed lower-case letter
indicating a snapshot of the CVS source tree.

*** Release 1.05 ; 2014-11-18
From the release notes:
This release includes a ridiculous amount of commits since 1.04.
ELM interfaces now have at least basic functionality. Limited testing so far.

*** Release 1.02 2014-03-23
From the release notes:
Many fixes to win32 code.
New in 1.02:
Windows version has a lot of self-verification for timing, and a small amount of self-adjustment as well.
All platforms: there is now a special debugging mode for troubleshooting dumb interfaces.

Fixes: (summary of CVS commits)

diag_l0_dumb : fixed spurious detection of sync byte
diag_l0_elm : doesn't support raw L1 proto (only iso 9141 & 14230)
new L1 flag (DIAG_L1_AUTOSPEED) for smart interfaces
diag_l1_setspeed is only called from diag_l2_ioctl now
bug #16: removed function pointers in debugging messages
diag_tty_break win32 : added auto-adjustment of timeout (running average)
added L line polarity option for L0_dumb devices.
added optional diag_tty_fastbreak (specifically for iso14230 fast init)
diag_l0_dumb : added optional fastbreak & unified initbus functions
added TRY_POSIX build option in CMake and Autotools
bug #13: diag_l0_dumb uses manual 5bps init by default (MAN_BREAK) now.
cleaned some redundant delays (i.e. more than one level waiting W5 before initbus, etc.)
Sanitized alloc/free management in L2 startcomms & stopcomms functions
sanitized USE_RCFILE defines
A *lot* of code cleanup and commenting. freediag almost compiles without any warnings on at least a few platforms.
Misc improvements to the CMake build system.


*** Release 1.01 2014-03-04
Codename "phoenix zombie".
From the release notes :
- freediag now compiles and runs on Win32 ! Very preliminary pre-alpha status.
- A lot of small fixes, hopefully not breaking the rest of the codebase.
- bugfix : #15, diag_tty_break broken on win32 (64-bit ints)
- bugfix : #12, struct pid has a member named sprintf
- bugfix : #10, *printf format warnings / missing casts / other dumb errors
- bugfix : #8, shell script permissions

- old style device IDs no longer supported. Previously :
"set interface xyz 2" would use /dev/ttyOBDII2 as the device name. Now the full name must
be entered :
"set interface xyz /dev/ttyS0" for instance, or "set interface xyz \\.\COM16" on Win.
However the code is still in place for the old behavior. See CMakeLists.txt or otherwise define
OLD_DEVNAME before compiling. (i.e. "make -DOLD_DEVNAME" should do the trick with autotools)

- removed SE9141 and VAG interface files; they fall under the category "DUMB" and shared the exact same code ( diag_l0_dumb.c )
by default they will not build but the source files are still in the repo for a while.
To use a K-line only interface, use something like " set interface dumb /dev/ttyUSB2" ;
To use K + L line interfaces (VAGTOOL and some others), "set interface vagtool /dev/ttyS0".

- CMake build system (in addition to the old GNU autotools system). Mainly for Win32 but is
 supposed to work on linux, UNIX and OSX.
 
 
*** Release 1.00c 2011-06-09
(copied from release notes :)
- ELM preliminary support added, possibly filled with bugs.
- Systems with kernel>=2.6 will probably have timing problems
- CARSIM interface should work reliably
- Dumb serial interfaces (VAGTOOL, SE9141) are merged into one file, diag_l0_dumb.c . "set interface dumb /dev/ttyS0" will enable this interface.
- Next release will remove the separate VAGTOOL & SE device files. They will be totally replaced by the single "dumb" driver, which will be configurable to use (or not) the L-line. This was the only difference between the two drivers.


*** Release 1.00b 2011-05-29
(copied from release notes :)
- ELM support is still not complete (though under way)
- Systems with kernel>=2.6 will probably have timing problems
- CARSIM interface should work reliably


*** Release 1.00a 2011-05-21
A snapshot of the actual CVS tree, with the goal of making a source code package available for
download. Many people will not bother with CVS just to try some experimental software.
This was the first package released since freediag-0.3, and did not include many new features.

*** Version 1.0.0 (2004-06-04 , not packaged for release?)

The freediag project had effectively 'died'.  No commits had been
made to the CVS repository in six months - no releases had been made
in almost a year and all of the forums and mailing lists were idle.

In resurrecting the project, it was necessary to take several 'personal'
versions that people had been working on (and been unable to contribute
back to the CVS respository) - and commit all of those changes in one
mighty change.

It's hard to list the differences between 0.3 and the first of these
'reborn' freediags - so I've chosen to start with a new (three part)
version number to indicate this radical rebirth.

The vast majority of changes are due to Peter Dufault - to whom much
is owed.

*** Version 0.3 ; 2003-04-20

Changes 0.2->0.3

1) Fix timing issue in idle code where idle responses arent always read
   on "smart" interfaces (me/br) and then confuse the application
2) Fix iso14230 code so that it works with message >127 bytes (bad typecast)
3) Fix BR-1 ISO9141 support
4) Support the "new BR-1 interface with ISO14230"
5) Support response from multiple ECUs in Scantool (lots of changes)
6) Make scantool read CVN instead of just how many messages to get CVN
7) ISO14230 now will use "user" supplied addresses on a per message basis
   - it will use the original connection addresses if 0 is supplied as a
   src/dest address to the send() routine and for all idle (tester present)
   messages
8) Start of elm device support [iso interface only]
9) Support ISO9141-2 cars which return keybyte 0x94 0x94, not just 0x08 0x08
10) Ensure set source address is used by scantool correctly
11) Added local mkdep for more portability
12) Removed some typecasts in defines used in case statements as this breaks
	latest versions of GCC

*** Version 0.2 ; 2002-06-12

Changes 0.1->0.2

Thanks to Bjorn Helgaas for much of this stuff ! And others for testing ...

1) Fix J1979 idle message format (affects ISO9141 cars)
2) Fix coredump on ISO9141 cars caused by uninitialised timer
3) Add basic J1850 support for smart interfaces such as Multiplex Engineering
4) Support for B. Roadman BR1 interface
5) diag_l1_open now checks layer 1 supported protocols against requested protocol
6) Fix a lot of the display of values in monitor mode
7) Add English display of units (configurable between English and Metric)
8) Fix many spelling errors in comments and printed messages
9) Extended data logging
10) Readline() support to give command line editing in the scantool
11) autoconf to make it build on Linuxs other then Redhat
12) diag_l1() bug where if you scanned, then changed interface type and scanned again, coredump
13) Fixed ISO14230 slow init to expect correct keybytes
14) Scantool handles h/w interface open failure nicely now
15) Get/Display Stored DTCs (mode 3) instead of just printing how many DTCs
16) Move O/S specific serial code into diag_os_linux.c from layer 0 drivers
17) Add $HOME/.scantoolrc startup command file support
18) Add ability to read in command files (source command)
19) Various other minor fixes

*** Version 0.1 ; 2002-01-17
