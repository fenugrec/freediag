freediag build system overview

Note : since release 1.06, the autotools (./configure etc.)  build system has been removed. I could not maintain
it to the same level of functionality as the CMake buildsys.

1- instructions for cmake
**** 1A- Steps to compile freediag on MS Windows ****
To compile freediag on win, the general process is as such (rename directories as required)
	-make sure cmake is installed and %PATH% holds the cmake/bin directory
	-extract the source tree (git clone, or a source package) to somewhere\srcdir\
	-make an empty build directory not far from the source tree, I recommend srcdir\..\builddir\
	-cd to builddir
	-run "cmake-gui ..\srcdir" : this uses the current directory (builddir) to store the CMake cache & all output files.
	-set the desired "Generator" (i.e. I use "MingW native toolchain" but you could select VS9 or whatever)
	-click Configure then Generate.
	 (Make sure to look at the configurable options. The nearest equivalent to "./configure --help" would
	 be "cmake -L", or browsing the cached variable list from cmake-gui.
	-compile according to your selected toolchain. I run mingw32-make from the builddir and off it goes.
	
**** 1B- Steps to compile freediag on linux ****
The instructions given above for Win may be used almost as-is on linux; here are methods without using
"cmake-gui"
	-extract the source tree (git clone, or a source package) to  <srcdir>
	-make an empty build directory not far from the source tree, I recommend <srcdir>/../<builddir>
	-cd to builddir (important !!)
	
	either A) (preferred, if ncurses is available)
		-run "ccmake [-G <generator_name>] ../<srcdir>"
		(note: specifying -G <generator name> may be optional, I think it defaults to "UNIX Makefiles" )
		-press "c" to configure
		-customize options as required
		-press "g" to generate Makefiles or project files as applicable
	or B) ( command-line only)
		-run "cmake [-G <generator_name>] ../<srcdir>" ; example : "cmake ../freediag"
		(note: specifying -G <generator name> may be optional, I think it defaults to "UNIX Makefiles"
		 which is usually fine.)
	
		-As required, run "cmake -L" to view current cache values. This is similar to "./configure --help".
		-As required, run "cmake -D <var>:<type>=<value>" to modify one of the previously listed values, such as
		 USE_RCFILE, etc. Example : "cmake -D USE_RCFILE:BOOL=ON" 
		 
	then
	-run make; or open IDE project file if applicable


If generating makefiles, there are a few special targets added by CMake :
	- make edit_cache		// open cmake-gui cache editor if applicable
	- make package		// generate a binary package
	- make package_source	// generate source tar.gz
	- make help		//show available targets

Once the Makefiles are generated, it's usually not necessary to run cmake again unless the CMakeLists.txt files
were changed, or build options were changed. 

3- CMake background info
I added a CMake build system specifically to support WIN targets, as the GNU autotools
(autoconf, ./configure & friends) are not trivial to use on MS platforms. CMake should also make
other platforms (OSX) easier to support as well.
The main drawback is that the CMake package is quite large (~30MB), and is an additional
dependency that I force on anyone who wants to compile freediag. However, as of 1.06 (09-2015),
I no longer maintain the autotools build system.

As distributed, the CMake build system for freediag consists of the following files in
the source tree :
cconf.h.in 		// manually edited, it is eventually parsed by CMake to create cconf.h
CMakeLists.txt	//there's one of these in every subdirectory with compiled code.

The CMakeLists.txt are roughly equivalent to the autotools' configure.ac and Makefile.am files, which
are edited manually to describe the build process : dependencies, required source files, executable names, etc.
