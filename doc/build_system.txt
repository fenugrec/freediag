**************** instructions for cmake ****************

**** 1A- Steps to compile freediag on win with MS Windows Visual Studio 2019/Visual Studio Code ****

To compile freediag on win using these IDEs, the general process is as such
    -extract the source tree (git clone, or a source package).
    -make sure cmake version 3.10 or higher is installed and %PATH% holds the cmake/bin directory.
	 Visual Studio 2019 has a cmake installation integrated so no extra action is required.
	-open the source directory from the IDE. Visual Studio 2019 has the option "Open local folder" which
	 will start the cmake integration automatically. There is no need to generate MSBuild project files
	 with cmake although this works as well. Visual Studio Code may suggest the installation of serveral
	 extensions (e.g. C/C++ support, IntelliSense, CMake Tools).
	-the cmake integration in both IDEs will guide you through the cmake configuration process.
	-Visual Studio Code will detect existing MinGW and Visual Studio Build Tool installations. The
	 Borland/Embarcadero Compiler (e.g Embarcadero C++ Compiler Tools or C++ Builder Community Edition)
	 can be added manually. For Visual Studio 2019 the build targets x86/x64 Debug/Release are tested.
	-After configuration start the build process in the IDE.

**** 1B- Steps to compile freediag on win with MS Windows Visual Studio 2019 for Windows XP (toolset 141_xp) ****

To compile freediag on win using these IDEs, the general process is as such
    -extract the source tree (git clone, or a source package).
    -make sure cmake version 3.14 or higher is installed and %PATH% holds the cmake/bin directory.
	-from the Visual Studio 2019 installer install "MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++x64/x86-Buildtools(v14.16)
	 and "C++-Windows XP-Support for Tools in VS 2017 (v141) [deprecated]".
	-open a "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2019" command prompt.
	-from the command prompt configure the project like is to build Windows XP 32bit binaries:

		cmake -G"Visual Studio 16 2019"
		      -A Win32
			  -T v141_xp
			  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="cl"
			  -DCMAKE_CC_COMPILER="cl"
			  -S <source directory>
			  -B <build directory>

	-use msbuild or cmake --build <build directory> to build the project.

**** 1C- Steps to compile freediag on MS Windows using Cmake GUI and MinGW ****

To compile freediag on win, the general process is as such (rename directories as required)
	-make sure cmake is installed and %PATH% holds the cmake/bin directory
	-extract the source tree (git clone, or a source package) to somewhere\srcdir\
	-make an empty build directory not far from the source tree, I recommend srcdir\..\builddir\
	-cd to builddir
	-run "cmake-gui ..\srcdir" : this uses the current directory (builddir) to store the CMake cache & all output files.
	-set the desired "Generator" (i.e. I use "MingW native toolchain" but you could select VS9 or whatever)
	-click Configure then Generate.
	 (Make sure to look at the configurable options. The nearest equivalent to "./configure --help" would
	 be "cmake -L", or browsing the cached variable list from cmake-gui.
	-compile according to your selected toolchain. I run mingw32-make from the builddir and off it goes.



**** 1D- Steps to compile freediag on linux ****

The instructions given above for Win may be used almost as-is on linux; here are methods without using
"cmake-gui"
	-extract the source tree (git clone, or a source package) to  <srcdir>
	-make an empty build directory not far from the source tree, I recommend <srcdir>/../<builddir>
	-cd to builddir (important !!)

	either A) (preferred, if ncurses is available)
		-run "ccmake [-G <generator_name>] ../<srcdir>"
		(note: specifying -G <generator name> may be optional, I think it defaults to "UNIX Makefiles" )
		-press "c" to configure
		-customize options as required
		-press "g" to generate Makefiles or project files as applicable
	or B) ( command-line only)
		-run "cmake [-G <generator_name>] ../<srcdir>" ; example : "cmake ../freediag"
		(note: specifying -G <generator name> may be optional, I think it defaults to "UNIX Makefiles"
		 which is usually fine.)

		-As required, run "cmake -L" to view current cache values. This is similar to "./configure --help".
		-As required, run "cmake -D <var>:<type>=<value>" to modify one of the previously listed values, such as
		 USE_RCFILE, etc. Example : "cmake -D USE_RCFILE:BOOL=ON"

	then
	-run make; or open IDE project file if applicable


If generating makefiles, there are a few special targets added by CMake :
	- make edit_cache		// open cmake-gui cache editor if applicable
	- make package		// generate a binary package
	- make package_source	// generate source tar.gz
	- make help		//show available targets

Once the Makefiles are generated, it's usually not necessary to run cmake again unless the CMakeLists.txt files
were changed, or build options were changed.



**************** CMake background info ****************

I added a CMake build system specifically to support WIN targets, as the GNU autotools
(autoconf, ./configure & friends) are not trivial to use on MS platforms. CMake should also make
other platforms (OSX) easier to support as well.


As distributed, the CMake build system for freediag consists of the following files in the source tree :

- cconf.h.in 		// manually edited, it is eventually parsed by CMake to create cconf.h
- CMakeLists.txt	//there's one of these in every subdirectory with compiled code.

The CMakeLists.txt are roughly equivalent to the autotools' configure.ac and Makefile.am files, which
are edited manually to describe the build process : dependencies, required source files, executable names, etc.

4- Debian/Ubuntu build simple script
Install requirements:

	sudo apt install wget unzip build-essential cmake g++ make pkg-config

Download latest sources (via wget):

	wget -O freediag.zip https://github.com/fenugrec/freediag/archive/master.zip
	unzip freediag.zip
	cd freediag-master
	./build_simple.sh

**************** running CMake test suite ****************

There are a few tests to verify minimal functionality.
Automating tests of software such as freediag is very challenging as it can run on a vast assortment of hardware, to connect with a wide variety of ECUs.

The current test strategy is :

- a collection of script-like tests in the test/ subfolder, comprising of .ini scripts and carsom .db files.
- a standalone program, `diag_test`, to "exercise code paths not easy to test through the .ini-based testsuite."

To run the ini-based tests in 16x parallel:
`ctest -j 16`
To skip the tests that need a connected dumb interface :
`ctest -I 3 -j 16`
