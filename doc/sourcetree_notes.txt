This is bits and pieces of descriptions of elements of the source code. The
code can be confusing, and it takes time to become familiar with all the
data structures, functions, etc. In the ~15 years' existence of the project,
I think no one took the trouble of documenting the source code beyond 
comments directly in the source. This is OK but I felt there was a need for
a short document that would explain some concepts more in detail, a sort
of quick-reference guide for understanding / hacking freediag.
At the moment this is just a collection of notes : whenever I spend
more than a few minutes investigating something in the code, I write
a brief summary in here. Hopefully this will benefit someone else
as well.
*** general notes
Physical interfaces (i.e. ELM323, dumb adaptor, etc) are connected to a serial port (usually called
"subinterface" in the code). Only one L0 driver can use a given "subinterface", ex.: /dev/ttyUSB0
(a subinterface) is used exclusively by diag_l0_elm (the L0 driver) to manage a physical ELM32x interface.
This association is described in a "struct diag_l0_device", often named "dl0d" in the code.

*** data structures

struct diag_l0_device : unique association between an l0 driver (diag_l0_dumb
for instance) and a hardware resource (serial port, file, etc). The current implementation supports
only one L1 proto per L0 device; this will change. diag_l0_new() creates a new, empty, diag_l0_device
struct that must be configured (diag_l0_getcfg() etc), then opened with diag_l0_open().

struct diag_l0 : every diag_l0_???.c driver fills in one of these to describe itself. It includes
its name, supported L1 protos, and pointers to "exposed" functions (diag_l0_initbus, _setspeed, etc).
Those diag_l0 structs are accessible only through the l0dev_list[] array in diag_config.c

struct diag_l2_proto : every diag_l2_???.c handler fills in one of these to describe itself. As
with 'struct diag_l0' above, these are accessible through l2proto_list[].

struct diag_l2_link : these are alloc'ed + filled by diag_l2_open; diag_l2_links is a linked-list
 of all the active l2 links. An l2 link associates a diag_l0_device with one L1 protocol. This
 struct also holds flags (inits supported, etc.). diag_l2_link structs are not used outside
 diag_l2{.c, .h}.
 Note : despite the name, diag_l2_link says nothing about the L2 protocol used.
 See struct diag_l2_conn
 
struct diag_l2_conn : these are alloc'ed + filled by diag_l2_startcommunications() only !
 and they are free'd in diag_l2_stopcommunications. This is a complex structure defined in
 diag_l2.h; it specifies a diag_l2_link, an l2 protocol handler and a lot of flags & settings.
 A diag_l2_conn is needed to use the "public" l2 functions (_send, _request, _ioctl, etc.)
 The existence of a diag_l2_conn indicates connection to an ECU has been established
 (or a monitoring / "sniffing" connection has been established). A diag_l2_conn can be used
 by (one or more ?) L3 connection(s), see struct diag_l3_conn.
 
struct diag_l3_conn : these are alloc'ed / freed by diag_l3_start and diag_l3_stop, respectively;
 and added to the global diag_l3_list linked list. Associates a diag_l2_conn with a diag_l3_proto.
 
struct diag_msg : this hold a message received from, or to be sent to, an ECU. Holds a bunch
 of flags, and a data buffer. Only diag_allocmsg() and diag_freemsg() should be used for
 dynamically allocating these structs, as they take care of cleaning up pointers as required.
 Messages can be linked with the ->next member. The ->iflags member should probably not
 be touched ever (used by _allocmsg() and _freemsg())

 
*** functions

diag_l2_close : this is called from cmd_diag_disconnect to close the global_l2_dl0d XXX

diag_l1_close calls the ->diag_l0_close func of the specified diag_l0_device; this terminates
 an existing link between an l0 driver and its serial port. Only called in diag_l2_closelink;
diag_l2_closelink is called by diag_l2_open only ? so nothing ever closes the l0 devices ! XXX

diag_l2_open: calls diag_l1_open with specified l0name, subinterface, l1proto;
 adds a diag_l2_link to the diag_l2_links linked-list if successful. For some reason
 this returns struct diag_l0_device .

diag_l1_open: finds l0name in the linked list l0dev_list; calls the l0 driver's diag_l0_open
 function with the specified subinterface and L1 proto.  Returns the struct diag_l0_device *
 it got from ->diag_l0_open.
diag_l1_open is currently only called from diag_l2_open.

->diag_l0_open(...) : this function, defined by each l0 driver, alloc's + fills a new diag_l0_device struct.
 


diag_l0_initbus : these are called by diag_l1_initibus; diag_l1_initbus is only called by
 diag_l2_ioctl.
diag_l0_initbus is assumed to return at exactly :
- the end of tWUP, if iso14230 fastinit (just in time to send the startcomm request)
- right after receiving the 0x55 sync byte, if iso9141 or iso14230 slowinit (just in time to get the 2x keybytes)


diag_tty_write : diag_l0_dumb, in certain cases, would need this to be non-blocking... I'm unsure of how
the different implementations handle this.


cmd_diag_addl3 : this supposes we already have a global L2 connection to an ECU; it
 defines global_l3_conn if diag_l3_start() is succesfull.
 
cmd_diag_reml3 : does the opposite of addl3

**** layer "tree"
As of 1.01, here's roughly how the layers can be interconnected :

"subinterface" : a physical serial port. The code calls this a subinterface for some unknown reason;
 I think it was an abstraction for something that is now absent in the code... -> NOPE ! in
 the distant past it was "int subinterface" and was unused. At some point it was changed to "char
 *subinterface" and (ab)used to specify serial ports. XXX irrelevant soon

L0 :
any "subinterface" can be associated with only one l0 driver. This link is defined in
a struct diag_l0_device described earlier;
Most L0 drivers don't support multiple "instances" of themselves (i.e. trying to use an ELM on ttyS0
and another ELM on ttyS1 at the same time); this is partly due to global variables in each l0 driver.
Also, no precautions have been taken to make the l0 drivers re-entrant (see async-safeness note
later in this doc), so attempting this could be dangerous !

L1 : this is mostly a "glue" layer: the differences between L1 protocols (DIAG_L1_* in diag_l1.h) are
handled in the l0 drivers. The code in diag_l1.c interprets the L1flags and acts accordingly; this
makes it mostly pass-through except for diag_l1_send which takes care of P4 timing and half-duplex
removal.
There are no specific data structures linking the L1 and L0 levels.

L2 : This layer tries to abstract most of the differences between standards. Data
received from L0 levels is framed and stripped of headers + checksum bytes at the L2 level in the _recv()
functions. When sending data on the bus with _send(), L2 also adds headers and checksums as
required, so L3 and up don't need to bother with this.

L3 : 

**** Serial ports
Two main issues : setting custom baud rates (essential for ISO9141/14230 traffic @ 10.4kbps), and
enforcing precise timeouts (very useful for splitting ISO9141/14230 messages).
1. Custom baud rates
1a. Linux : a super mess, see diag_tty_unix.c
	http://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2013/11/linux-custom-serial-baud-rates/
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12646324/how-to-set-a-custom-baud-rate-on-linux
	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683826
1b. Windows : seems to work ok, does not require any black magic, at least for some USB-RS232 ICs

2. Timeouts
2a. Linux : Unfortunately the standard method of enforcing a read timeout, c_cc[VTIME] in struct termios,
 is not good enough (100ms resolution). A few alternate methods are implemented :
	- a POSIX timer that interrupts the read() call
	- select() with a timeout, looped
	- using /dev/rtc and select() (dubious implementation, possibly broken)
2b. Windows : seems to work ok with the standard SetCommTimeouts()

**** Time & freediag
Timing can make or break freediag, especially when using dumb interfaces. I will divide
the timing requirements in two aspects: measurement and control.
1. Measurement : freediag needs to measure time with different requirement "levels" depending
on the context:
	A- Determining when periodic communications need to be sent; this is done by
	 updating the tlast (time of last communication) member of every active connection. Since
	 the periodic callbacks are not called very frequently (3 to 10 times per second is more
	 than enough for ISO14230 and J1979 keep-alive requirements), this time measure can
	 be of low resolution and arbitrary zero-reference. diag_os_getms() covers this requirement.
	 One thing that needs to be guaranteed is monotonicity : the time returned by _getms()
	 needs to be always increasing. Most system time / clock functions are not monotonic;
	 they can jump forwards or back if time is adjusted by the user or the OS.
	 
	B- Logging comm events (in particular the rxtime member of struct diag_msg); this is
	 similar to A, but the ability to use an arbitrary reference (like a stopwatch) seemed useful
	 so I wrote diag_os_chronoms() for those cases.
	 
	C- Short interval, fine resolution (sub-ms) validation of certain operations. diag_os_gethrt()
	and diag_os_hrtus() provide this. The Windows implementation uses
	QueryPerformanceCounter() ; typically a monotonic 1-10MHz counter,
	 hopefully with little overhead per call and therefore little impact on the measured operation.
	Linux uses either POSIX clock_gettime() or gettimeofday() as a fallback.

2. Control : freediag needs to make certain things happen at precise times. Again this can
be seen as three requirement levels:
	A- Coarse : an error of >10ms is not a problem. The periodic
	 timer callbacks that take care of keepalive messages would qualify as Coarse: as long
	 as they are carried out within the required period (P3max=5s for ISO* and J1979),
	 communications with an ECU will not be perturbed. We could also include the delays
	 required before starting bus initialization routines (W5=300ms typically).
	 
	B- Medium : an error of <= 5ms is desirable, but 10ms is tolerable. Some examples include:
	 P3 (for ISO
	 protocols : time after all vehicle responses and before a new request; default is 55ms);
	 {W1,W2,W3,W4} : (ISO) 5bps slow initialization; P4 when P4 > 0 (ISO interbyte spacing,
	 if freediag must handle it - most smart interfaces already do). For those requirements,
	 diag_os_millisleep() is usually satisfactory since even on the worst systems, its
	 error is still within the allowed window (for instance W4max - W4min = 25ms; I have not
	 seen _millisleep() on any system I've tested, being off-spec by more than 25ms.
	 Freediag's current approach for this level is to call _millisleep(x) with x=minimum required
	 time, and assuming the thread will sleep for x + y ms; y >= 0. This usually works OK.
	 Arguably the manual-break 5bps init pattern generated by diag_l0_dumb could almost be
	 included in here; a bit time of 200ms +-  5ms (2.5%) will work with many cars since the
	 last bit will be skewed by less than 40ms and we can hope an ECU would sample the bits at
	 their middle (100ms), or thirds (66ms + 133ms).
	 
	C- Fine : an error <=2ms is required; <1ms  desirable. This is NOT easy, on any OS. The
	 good news is that only the L0 dumb driver needs this insane accuracy, for the ISO
	 bus initialisations. The 5bps init pattern mentioned above really belongs here (1% of
	 5bps : 2ms). The fast init of iso14230 is very fragile : we need to send a break on TX
	 for 25ms +- 1ms, and send the StartComm request 50ms +- 1ms after starting the break.
	 So the 25ms break is already hard to get right (although sending 0x00 at 360bps
	 is an interesting solution), but then we need to start sending bytes a very precise time
	 after the break started. Also, if the OS decides to switch tasks 1ms before we send
	 StartComm, our thread will certainly be re-activated too late. This is in part why
	 it's sometimes necessary to re-try the ECU wakeup a few times until the timing is
	 just right, although some ECUs seem more permissive.
	 
As much as possible, using an OS-provided sleep function (that yields execution and allows
other tasks/processes to run) should be used for long delays. On a single-process machine
(like a microcontroller) it's easy to make NOP loops to wait for a precise number of clock cycles
but the same can't be done on a typical multitasking OS.
The Win implementation of diag_os_millsleep() is a hybrid of Sleep() and a NOP loop;
it tries Sleep() for larger requested delays. It burns off the remaining
time in a NOP loop. This should work OK if the OS doesn't interrupt us again right after Sleep()
returns or before we have time to finish our next critical operation.

**** diag_l2_timer() & diag_l3_timer(), callbacks
To handle keepalive messages of the various protocols, freediag sets up an OS-specific
periodic callback function (see diag_os_*.c). This calls diag_l2_timer() and diag_l3_timer();
these functions parse through the active connections and call the _timeout() functions
as required. The callback function is called at a higher frequency than typical
keep-alive message requirements (ex.: callback interval=300ms; iso14230
needs a TesterPresent request every 5000ms).

**** diag_l2_recv callbacks
XXX


**** "async signal safe"ness, re-entrant functions, callbacks etc.
This is currently (2014) a bit of a mess. The previous devs knew this was the
next big problem to tackle, so they flagged many parts of the code as non-async signal
safe AKA "not re-entrant". These functions (and others) should be made re-entrant, i.e.
take the necessary precautions so that, if a thread is currently executing
the function, another thread can safely call the same function. Easier said than done:
for instance the global linked-list of L2 connections if often accessed / modified
from a lot of different places (not only in diag_l2.c); if for example the main thread
is creating or deleting an L2 connection and the periodic callback interrupts it,
there may be problems when the periodic timer function tries to access the same
data that was in the process of being modified.

Luckily this shouldn't happen very often in freediag since the periodic timer functions
(called by the OS automatically at a preset interval, typically for sending keep-alive
messages) are not called often. But, if a protocol handler calls a _send
function for its keep-alive message, while the user was already transmitting a
request (which requires the same low-level functions), this will be a problem.

A possible solution would be to create a diag_os_lock() function that uses OS-specific
locking mechanisms (mutex, etc), to make most low-level functions re-entrant.
(Probably L2, L3 and everything below since the timer callbacks use both
L2 and L3 functions). To avoid deadlocks, the periodic timer callback could wait without
blocking (ex.: WaitForSingleObject of Win API) while trying to acquire the lock.

In addition, the periodic timer callbacks should be protected in case they get called
before the previous keepalive isn't complete (if for some reason it took longer to
complete than the timer interval).

**** elements that should have async safeness :
(very incomplete list)
debug flags;
printf / fprintf
diag_os_getms()
diag_os_millisleep()
global connection linked-lists and associated structures
*alloc() should not be called from the timeout functions (it is: if the L2 timeout
function receives a message, it alloc's it). Maybe freediag's wrappers (diag_?alloc())
could be made re-entrant with locks + waits.
