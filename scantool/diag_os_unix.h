/****** OS-specific implementation selectors ******/
/*	These are for testing/debugging only, to force compilation of certain
   implementations for diag_tty* and diag_os* functions.

	### Map of features with more than one implementation related to POSIX ###

	## time-related features ##
	SEL_PERIODIC: Periodic timer callback (for L2+L3 keepalives)
		A) needs _POSIX_TIMERS, uses timer_create()
		B) (available everywhere?) setitimer+sigaction to install a SIGALRM handler
	SEL_SLEEP: diag_os_millisleep()
		A) needs _POSIX_TIMERS, uses clock_nanosleep()
		B) needs __linux__ && (uid==root), uses /dev/rtc
		C) (available everywhere?) nanosleep() loop
	SEL_HRT: diag_os_gethrt()
		A) needs _POSIX_TIMERS, uses clock_gettime()
		B) (available everywhere?) gettimeofday()

	## misc features ##
	SEL_SCHED: diag_os_sched() : increasing priority ; check uid
		A) _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING && __linux__ : set scheduling to realtime.
		B) _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING : check uid; #warn; change nothing.
		C) All others : #warn; change nothing.
	######
	For every feature listed above, it's possible to force compilation of
	a specific implementation using the #defines below.
	TODO: add compile tests to cmake?
